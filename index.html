                <h2>STORY</h2>
                <p>Miles Morales, a teenager who admires Spider-Man, struggles living up to the
                    expectations of his parents, especially his father, police officer Jefferson Davis (Brian Tyree
                    Henry), who sees Spider-Man as a menace. Miles lives with Jefferson and mother Rio (Luna Lauren
                    Velez). Jefferson believes that the police put their life on the line on a daily basis without
                    any
                    superpowers and spider-man takes all the credit. Miles has recently been enrolled to new school
                    which he considers elitist. Gwanda is his only friend at the new school and she is also a
                    recently
                    enrolled student. After school, Miles secretly visits his uncle Aaron Davis (Mahershala Ali)
                    (The
                    Prowler), who brings Miles to an abandoned subway station where he can paint graffiti. While
                    there,
                    Miles is unknowingly bitten by a radioactive spider and, the next day, discovers it gave him
                    spider-like abilities, including the power to turn invisible, and to emit electric venom blasts.
                    Reading the comic books, Miles realizes that he is Spider-man. He is astonished that there can
                    be 2
                    spider-men.</p>
